# Prodigy Infotech Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for my Prodigy Infotech Internship projects! This repository showcases all the projects I'll be working on as a Frontend Intern during this month.

## üìÇ Naming Conventions

Each subrepository within this main repository is named based on the week of the internship. The format is as follows:
- `prodigy`: Refers to the company name.
- `wd`: Stands for Web Development.

### Examples:
